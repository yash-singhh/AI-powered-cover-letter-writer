Ensuring Professional Quality: Utilizes a professional template to maintain consistency and high standards.
Enhancing Customization: Allows users to input specific details to tailor each cover letter to the job and company.
Saving Time: Reduces the time spent on writing and formatting cover letters, enabling users to focus on other aspects of their job search.
Key Features
Interactive User Input Collection:

Guides users through a series of prompts to gather essential information such as personal details, job specifics, background, and motivations.
Personalized Cover Letter Generation:

Utilizes a predefined template populated with user-provided information to create a customized cover letter.
Multiple Output Formats:

Allows users to save the generated cover letter in .txt format.
Offers optional PDF generation using the reportlab library for enhanced presentation.
Customization Options:

Users can specify filenames and choose whether to include optional sections like LinkedIn profiles or relocation constraints.
Error Handling:

Provides feedback if optional dependencies (like reportlab for PDF generation) are missing, ensuring a smooth user experience.
Extensible and Modifiable Codebase:

The script is designed to be easily customizable, allowing users to modify templates or add new features as needed.
Functionality
The AI Cover Letter Generator operates through the following steps:

Collecting User Information:

The script prompts the user to input various details required for the cover letter, including personal information, job details, work experience, skills, achievements, motivation, and any additional points.
Generating the Cover Letter:

Using the collected information, the script populates a predefined cover letter template. Python's f-string formatting ensures that the user's data seamlessly integrates into the template.
Optional sections, such as LinkedIn profiles or constraints, are included based on user input.
Displaying the Generated Cover Letter:

The script outputs the generated cover letter in the terminal, allowing the user to review it before deciding to save.
Saving the Cover Letter:

If the user chooses to save the cover letter, they can specify a filename or accept the default (Cover_Letter.txt).
The user is then prompted to save the cover letter as a PDF if the reportlab library is installed. If not, the script informs the user and proceeds accordingly.
The cover letter is saved in the chosen format(s), making it ready for submission with job applications.
